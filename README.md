# Multi-Step Form – Frontend Mentor Challenge

Hi! I'm Ahmed Seleem. This is a multi-step form project I built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.

It showcases my front-end development skills, including responsive layout design, form validation, and dynamic UI interactions using vanilla JavaScript.
